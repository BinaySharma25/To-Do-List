# To-Do-List
I developed a simple and responsive To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It features a clean and user-friendly interface with dynamic updates and local storage integration, so tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.
